Custom Plugins
=================

In addition to the built-in classes that are provided for
:ref:`configuration_localization`, :ref:`configuration_observation`, and
:ref:`configuration_state`, an API is provided allowing a user to code their
own classes without have to make any changes to the core LETKF library code.

   Obviously this needs documentation, something I will add once the need
   arises.
